# Steering Design CoPilot
A Python application that calculates Ackerman steering angles for vehicles based on user input. This project includes a minimal GUI for user-friendly interaction.

## Features
- Calculate Ackerman steering angles with precision.
- User-friendly GUI for input and output.
- Ideal for automotive engineers, designers, and enthusiasts for steering system design.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the `gui.py` file to launch the GUI application.
3. Input the wheelbase, track width, and turn radius in the provided fields.
4. Click the "Calculate" button to compute the inner and outer wheel angles.
5. The calculated angles will be displayed on the GUI.

## Note
- This project is a demonstration of calculating Ackerman steering angles and creating a minimal GUI for interaction.

## Dependencies
- Python
- Tkinter (for the sophisticated GUI)
